# Scala Works

Hello, friend ðŸ‘‹, and welcome to your journey into the Scala programming
language! `Scala Works` aims to be your guide to help get started in the
ecosystem. It's currently one person with a crazy idea, but now that you're here
it's two - we're already stronger together! We, as a community, aim to be open
in hearing your challenges, frustrations, and tips to make working with Scala as
drop-dead simple as possible.

## Who is Scala Works for?

Scala is a wonderfully flexible language, and we're not here to tell you what is
"right" - because ultimately what is right, is between you, your team, and your
projects. If you've already figured that out, then don't take our suggestions as
gospel or an attack.

We will talk authoritatively about code style, formatting, structuring, etc...
but please know this comes from a place of _education_ and not a
_authoritarianism_. We aim to provide _a_ collection of best practices, **not**
_the definitive_ collection of best practices to help port your experience in
other programming languages to Scala.

With that in mind:

**We aim to be for:**

- People who are new to Scala, that don't have their own "style" opinions yet
- People who are looking for a broader idea of "style" out there
- People who just want to adopt a style, and get coding

**We do NOT aim to be for:**

- People who already have developed their own "style" and prefer to do their own
  thing.
- People completely new to programming (but see the
  [Learning Scala](#learning-scala) section for links)

## What does Scala Works do?

Or, I should say _will do_, as we grow:

We, as a community, aim to provide a set of standard, best practices, and
"generally good advice" with things like:

- `.gitignore` files that consider all current Scala tooling
- `.scalafmt.conf` files to give you a style that keeps your codebase _standard_
- `.scalafix.conf` files to keep your codebase _clean_
- `project structure` recommendations, to keep your codebase _consistent_
- `project templates` that you can use that have all of the above already set up
  for you.

**Standard**. **Clean**. **Consistent**. It's amazing how far this can go to
make your codebase more approachable to everyone on your team.

We would also like to provide some slim frameworks/libraries that wrap (and
**not** re-invent) functionality from existing, excellent Scala libraries, in
order to provide good ergonomics around what we think are some "core, essential"
frameworks that every developer newly entering the ecosystem expects. With these
frameworks, one can learn the underlying tool without worrying about the edge
cases, and get to work. We think these include:

- HTTP/Web Server (REST and GraphQL)
- Front Ends (SPAs)
- Static Site Generators
- CLI tools

Building applications isn't worth much if you can't ship your code. We also aim
to provide advice for:

- General build/deployment strategies
- CI/CD strategies
- The platforms for Scala (JVM, ScalaJS, Scala Native)

## Join In

I've set up some topics in
[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/scala-works/scala-works/discussions) -
feel free to join in the discussion!

## Learning Scala

We're sure you'll pick up knowledge along the way, but there are already a great
number of absolutely amazing resources on _learning_ Scala. There is a great
list [here](https://docs.scala-lang.org/learn.html) on Scala's site.

With that in mind, we don't want to duplicate that effort. We're here to help
you _use_ Scala, and abstract utilities "up the stack", so the initial
boilerplate you might get stuck in can get out of the way.

## Stay Tuned

Saying that we're new, and growing is currently an understatement, but feel free
stay tuned as we start to set up more resources!
