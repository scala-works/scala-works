# Scala Works

Welcome to Scala Works! This repo is for the main site
(https://scala.works)[https://scala.works]

This site uses [nextra](https://nextra.site/) to build a md/mdx powered site. To
contribute, just start editing or adding files in the `src/pages` directory!

To adjust the page configuration (i.e. nav bar/ sidebar), check the (page
configuration)[https://nextra.site/docs/docs-theme/page-configuration] section
on the nextra doc site. TL;DR: this can be configured in the `_meta.json` files.

To preview locally, you first need to `yarn install` to make sure all the
dependencies are loaded, and then `yarn dev` to bring up a hot-reloading
instance you can view your changes on.
