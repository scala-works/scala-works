# Scala Rosetta Stone

This page is aimed to help developers coming from another language to understand
to project structure and tools for Scala.

It's currently a work in progress, and portions are incomplete. Contributions
are welcome if you want to add some helpful tips about `$LANGUAGE => Scala`.

## Build Tools

Scala is a compiled language, and we will talk about three build tools:

- `sbt`
- `mill`
- `scala-cli`

In Scala, the build tool typically manages your project dependencies.

## IDEs

There are generally three big options for writing Scala, where actionable
feedback from a compiler is given:

- IntelliJ Idea
- VS Code
- vim/emacs/other text editor

IntelliJ has a wide offering of IDEs for many languages. If you use one of their
other ones, then Idea (Community Edition) would likely be a great choice for
you.

If you are already familiar with VSCode, then it is a great option for Scala as
well! This editor via lsp with the metals plugin.

If you use vim/emacs/other, then you probably want to follow along with the info
about VSCode and metals.

## Coming from NodeJS

This section tries to help map concepts from NodeJs/Typescript projects to
Scala.

### SBT

- `build.sbt` is like `package.json`: You dependencies are declared here, along
  with some runnable scripts/tasks, and project information/automation.
- `~/.ivy2` and `~/.m2` are like `node_modules`. In Scala/Java, dependencies are
  globally cached in these directories.
- `<root>/src/main/scala` might be like `<root>/src`, where the
  top-level-directory of your source code files are located.
- Scala doesn't really have a `yarn` or `npm`, as it will be handled via `sbt`
