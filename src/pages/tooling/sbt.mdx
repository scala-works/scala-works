# SBT

[sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/) Is one of the most prevalent build tools in
the Scala ecosystem.

Here is the official
[sbt by example](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/sbt-by-example.html) page,
which is a great outline to get you started, and using sbt.

Despite the complex build/task scenarios it can perform, it is simple to use and
get started with. As with most build tools, there are a few idiosyncrasies to
familiarize yourself with. This page serves as a quick extension to the official
link above, and outlines a couple of the "tricky pieces".

## Building Towards: build.sbt

TODO put a final `build.sbt` here, so show a "final minimal" file that we're
building up towards, so it doesn't feeling daunting to learn it line-by-line
over the various sections.

```scala

ThisBuild / scalaVersion := "3.2.2"

lazy val root = project.in(file("."))
  .settings()

```

## The root project

sbt handles building both single and multiple projects. One quirky thing you
should know about right away is the `root` project. sbt will automatically
assume there is a root project if you don't define one, which allows you to get
started quickly without a lot of boilerplate definition.

For example, these two `build.sbt` files should be functionally equivalent

```scala
ThisBuild / scalaVersion := "3.2.2"
```

```scala
lazy val root = project.in(file("."))
  .settings(
    scalaVersion := "3.2.2"
  )
```

The tricky part comes in when you start adding more projects, or organizing your
code in a sub directory that is not in the `<root>` of your path. In that case,
sbt will _create_ a root project, and aggregate all other projects in the build.

For example, if we moved out code from `./` to `./my-project`, our `buildt.sbt`
file might look like

```scala
lazy val myProject = project.in(file("my-project"))
  .settings(
    scalaVersion := "3.2.2"
  )
```

And if we called `sbt compile`, what it's really doing is calling
`sbt root/compile`, and aggregating that task to `myProject` as well! Explicitly
stated, this might look like:

```scala

lazy val root = project.in(file("."))
  .aggregate(myProject)

lazy val myProject = project.in(file("my-project"))
  .settings(
    scalaVersion := "3.2.2"
  )
```

This can be a source of frustration, especially when going from a single project
to multiple projects as the source code grows - it might seem like something
"just stopped working", because a setting was being applied to the "root"
project, what what the "root" project was subtly changed! If this happens, you
can just manually add in the root project again (like in the explicit example
above), and adjust the settings to what you are expecting in relation to your
sub projects - for example maybe you only want the root project to aggregate a
subset of you other projects, and not all of them by default.

To help avoid confusion, although you can quickly get started with a one-liner
`build.sbt` file like `ThisBuild / scalaVersion := "3.2.2"`, you are encouraged
to actually define your projects (even a root one), so that it's more apparent
as to what is going on.

## ThisBuild

```scala
ThisBuild / scalaVersion := "3.2.2"
```

`ThisBuild` is used to factor out common settings across multiple sub-projects.
When a particular (sub-)project doesn't have a specific setting applied, then it
will fall back to a value specified in `ThisBuild`
