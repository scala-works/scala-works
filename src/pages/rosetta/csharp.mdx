# C#

Here's how Scala compares to C# in terms of tooling and project structure:

## Build Tools

C# developers typically use Microsoft's MSBuild or .NET Core's CLI (Command Line
Interface). In Scala, the most popular build tool is sbt, which is similar to
Maven or Gradle in the Java world. Sbt is a powerful and flexible tool that
provides a high level of automation, dependency management, and incremental
compilation, making it a popular choice for Scala developers.

## Package Managers

In C#, the most popular package manager is NuGet, which is integrated with
Visual Studio and .NET CLI. In Scala, the build tool typical is responsible for
managing dependencies as well. sbt's package management provides fine-grained
control over dependency versions and transitive dependencies.

## Dependency Caching

Both C# and Scala support dependency caching, which means that once a dependency
is downloaded, it can be reused across different projects or builds. In C#,
NuGet caches packages in a global location on the local file system. In Scala,
sbt caches dependencies in a local Ivy repository, which is similar to Maven's
local repository.

## Project Source Tree Structure

Regarding the project source tree structure, both C# and Scala follow a similar
structure, where source files are separated from build files, and the source
tree structure is typically divided into different directories for code and
tests. However, the actual folder structure can differ slightly between C# and
Scala projects.

Here's a typical file tree structure of a "Hello World" application including
tests in C#:

```
HelloWorld/
├── HelloWorld/
│   ├── Program.cs
└── HelloWorld.Tests/
    ├── ProgramTest.cs
```

And here's the equivalent file tree structure in Scala:

```
HelloWorld/
├── build.sbt
├── project/
│   ├── build.properties
│   ├── plugins.sbt
├── src/
│   ├── main/
│   │   └── scala/
│   │       └── HelloWorld.scala
│   └── test/
│       └── scala/
│           └── HelloWorldTest.scala
```

As you can see, the structure of a Scala project is slightly more complex, with
additional directories for sbt build files and project configuration.
