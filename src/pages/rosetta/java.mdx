# Java

## Build Tools

In terms of build tools, Java developers typically use tools such as Maven or
Gradle to manage dependencies and build projects. In Scala, the most popular
build tool is sbt, which provides similar functionality to Maven and Gradle but
with a more concise syntax. Sbt allows you to define dependencies, manage
compilation and testing, and package your application for deployment.

## Package Managers

Both Java and Scala have package managers to manage external dependencies. In
Java, the most popular package manager is Maven, which retrieves dependencies
from Maven Central, a central repository for Java libraries. In Scala, sbt has a
built-in package management system, which allows you to define dependencies in a
build file and automatically download and cache them as needed.

## Dependency Caching

Dependency caching is important for both Java and Scala, as it can speed up the
build process significantly. In Java, Maven caches dependencies in the user's
local Maven repository. In Scala, sbt caches dependencies in the user's local
Ivy2 cache.

## Project Tree Structure

Regarding the project source tree structure, both Java and Scala follow a
similar structure, where source files are separated from build files, and the
source tree structure is typically divided into different directories for code
and tests. However, the actual folder structure can differ slightly between Java
and Scala projects.

Here's a typical file tree structure of a "Hello World" application including
tests in Java:

```
HelloWorld/
├── src/
│   ├── main/
│   │   └── java/
│   │       └── HelloWorld.java
│   └── test/
│       └── java/
│           └── HelloWorldTest.java
└── pom.xml
```

And here's the equivalent file tree structure in Scala:

```
HelloWorld/
├── build.sbt
├── project/
│   ├── build.properties
│   ├── plugins.sbt
├── src/
│   ├── main/
│   │   └── scala/
│   │       └── HelloWorld.scala
│   └── test/
│       └── scala/
│           └── HelloWorldTest.scala
```

As you can see, the structure of a Scala project is quite similar to that of a
Java project, with additional directories for sbt build files and project
configuration.
