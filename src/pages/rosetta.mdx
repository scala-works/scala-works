# Scala Rosetta Stone

This page is aimed to help developers coming from another language to understand
to project structure and tools for Scala.

It's currently a work in progress, and portions are incomplete. Contributions
are welcome if you want to add some helpful tips about `$LANGUAGE => Scala`.


## Build Tools

Scala is a compiled language, and we generally will talk about three build
tools:

- `sbt`
- `mill`
- `scala-cli`

with sbt being the dominant one.

In Scala, the build tool typically manages your project dependencies.

## IDEs

There are generally three big options for writing Scala, where actionable
feedback from a compiler is given:

- IntelliJ Idea
- VS Code
- vim/emacs/other text editor

IntelliJ has a wide offering of IDEs for many languages. If you use one of their
other ones, then Idea (Community Edition) would likely be a great choice for
you.

If you are already familiar with VSCode, then it is a great option for Scala as
well! This editor via lsp with the metals plugin.

If you use vim/emacs/other, then you probably want to follow along with the info
about VSCode and metals.
